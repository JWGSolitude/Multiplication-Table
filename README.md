1.
(a) Output the formatted 9 × 9 multiplication table. (50%)
(b) Output the formatted m × n multiplication table, where m and n (m, n ∈ {1, . . . , 100}) are input by the user.
    Your program needs to check the legality of input values. (50%)

2. Write a program to calculate the following power sum and print its result:

    n^8 =1^8 +2^8 +···+n^8

where n is input by the user. Your program should use a doubly-nested loop for the calculation, instead of pow function.
Besides, it should also check the legality of input value.
